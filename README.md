# fake-product-review
The scope and need of online markets and e-commerce platforms are on the rise and many people buy products from these platforms. The amount of feedbacks for products as a result are also present in detail for users to analyze the product they are buying. This can work against the users as well because users can sometime bombard the review section with extreme opinion comments which can work in favor or against the product. Thus, we need to take care of this because this can be done either by the merchant to increase the value of his product or the user to degrade the ratings of that product.
